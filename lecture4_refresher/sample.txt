CHICAGO — Gun violence this past weekend in Chicago injured 54 people and claimed 12 lives. Sadly, bloody weekends are practically a cyclical occurrence in Chicago during late summer and early fall.

In August 2017, 63 people were shot and eight killed in one weekend. In 2016, 59 were shot and 17 killed the weekend before Halloween. In July 2015, 40 were shot and eight were killed in one weekend. Accompanying that pattern of violence is the spurt of national outrage and partisan criticism that follows.

“Chicago murders are direct result of one party Democratic rule for decades,” tweeted Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s lead lawyer and a former mayor of New York, in response to the tragedy. “Policing genius Jerry McCarthy can do for Chicago what I did for NYC. He was one of the architects of Compstat. Slashed homicides over 70%. Tens of thousands of lives saved.”

Mr. Giuliani was referring to Garry McCarthy, a former New York City police commander, former Chicago police superintendent and Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s electoral opponent. Mr. McCarthy disavowed the president’s and Mr. Giuliani’s politics while journalists quickly fact-checked Mr. Giuliani’s false claim in a similar batch of tweets that there had been 63 murders.

The political discourse around gun violence — much like that around climate change — relies on data and would greatly benefit from more careful use of it.
